This repository contains solutions to two programming exercises implemented in Java. The first exercise, "Integer Arithmetics Language", implemented in XMLManipulation.java file, 
presents an interpreter for a simple XML-based programming language designed for integer arithmetic operations. The interpreter supports variable definition, addition, and printing 
functionalities, with error handling capabilities to address scenarios like multiple variable definitions or undefined variables in arithmetic operations. 

The second exercise, "XML Document Inversion", implemented in XMLInverter.java file, involves a program that reads an XML file from disk, reverses the parent-child element relationships, 
and outputs the inverted XML structure to the standard output. 

Both solutions utilize Java and its built-in XML processing interface JAXP.
